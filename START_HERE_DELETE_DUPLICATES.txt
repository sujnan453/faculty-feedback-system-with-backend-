The tool will:
✅ Scan your database for duplicates
✅ Show you what will be kept/deleted
✅ Delete all duplicates automatically
✅ Keep one copy of each department

================================================================================
                        WHY THIS HAPPENED
================================================================================

The old code had a bug that created duplicate departments when:
- Adding faculty members
- Students submitting feedback
- Any operation that saved departments

This has been FIXED in the code, but existing duplicates must be deleted.

================================================================================
                        WHAT'S BEEN FIXED
================================================================================

✅ js/firebase-storage.js - Prevents new duplicates
✅ js/storage.js - Prevents new duplicates  
✅ student-register.html - Validates departments
✅ js/firebase-auth.js - Validates departments

✅ delete-duplicates-now.html - Deletes existing duplicates (USE THIS!)
